# hackpack-swift-ui

### Overview

In this hackpack we will cover the basics of SwiftUI and create a simple iOS app. SwiftUI is a framework that allows you to build user interfaces across all Apple platforms with the power of Swift. It is a declarative framework, meaning that you can describe your user interface in a declarative manner, and SwiftUI will handle the rest. SwiftUI is also cross-platform, meaning that you can use the same code to build apps for iOS, macOS, watchOS, and tvOS (assuming the user interface is updated to fit the platform). Without further ado, let's get started!

### Setup

1. Install Xcode from the App Store (https://apps.apple.com/us/app/xcode/id497799835?mt=12)

### Creating a New Project

1. Open Xcode and click "Create New Project"

3. Enter a product name. For the organization identifier, enter your name in reverse domain name notation (e.g. com.apple). Leave the rest of the fields as default and click "Next"

# About HackPacks ðŸŒ²

HackPacks are built by the [TreeHacks](https://www.treehacks.com/) team and contributors to help hackers build great projects at our hackathon that happens every February at Stanford. We believe that everyone of every skill level can learn to make awesome things, and this is one way we help facilitate hacker culture. We open source our hackpacks (along with our internal tech) so everyone can learn from and use them! Feel free to use these at your own hackathons, workshops, and anything else that promotes building :)

If you're interested in attending TreeHacks, you can apply on our [website](https://www.treehacks.com/) during the application period.

You can follow us here on [GitHub](https://github.com/treehacks) to see all the open source work we do (we love issues, contributions, and feedback of any kind!), and on [Facebook](https://facebook.com/treehacks), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/hackwithtrees), and [Instagram](https://instagram.com/hackwithtrees) to see general updates from TreeHacks.
